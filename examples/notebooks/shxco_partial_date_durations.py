        # Compare partial date duration logic

        Comparing `UndateInterval` with similar work from Shakespeare and Company Project (S&co for short).

        This notebook compares the `UndateInterval` duration calculation for date ranges between partially known dates with the similar logic implemented in the [Shakespeare and Company Project](https://shakespeareandco.princeton.edu/) [events dataset](https://doi.org/10.34770/nz90-ym25). Event start and end dates are in ISO8601 format and include as much precision for the date as is known; format is one of: YYYY, YYYY-MM, YYYY-MM-DD, --MM-DD

        Deciding how to calculate date ranges may be contextual; current UndateInterval logic includes both the start and the end date, while the S&co logic does not - so they are off by one. Once we make that adjustment, the borrowing durations in the S&co data match the logic in Undate.

        Subscription durations in S&co are sometimes known to be for a particular term (e.g. a year or six months) but without specific dates, perhaps only a year or year and month; Undate calculates durations based on the earliest and latest days in the range, so it overestimates these durations.
