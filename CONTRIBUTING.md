# Contributing to Undate - A fuzzy date Python library


Hey there!

If you found your way here that probably means you are curious about how to contribute to this project. This is great! We are always looking for new contributors. If you can't find the information you are looking for in this document or anywhere else in the repo, please consider [opening a ticket](https://github.com/dh-tech/hackathon-2022/issues) so we know there is something we need to address.

## Project Setup
Instructions on how to set up the project locally and how to run the tests can be found [in the Readme file](README.md).

## Submitting Changes
If you would like to contribute by submitting bug fixes, improvements, or new features, please fork the repository and then make a pull request to our main branch when you are ready. For details see [this description of the Forking Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow).

## Submitting Bug Reports and Feature Requests
If you find a bug or can think a feature you would really like to see being implemented, you can [create a new issue](https://github.com/dh-tech/hackathon-2022/issues). Please first look through the existing issues, however, to avoid duplication of issues.

If you report a bug, please include any error messages you get and a full description of the steps to reproduce the bug. For new feature requests, please clearly describe the functionality you are looking for and, if applicable, why any existing workflow does not suffice. Please also consider, fixing bugs and implementing new features yourself and submit pull request! :) 

## Getting Help
The best and recommended way to get help is to join the [DHTech Slack](https://dh-tech.github.io/join/) and ask for help there. Only in cases when this is not feasible at all, you can open a new issue and tag it with "Help Request".  

## DHTech
This project started during the DHTech 2022 Hackathon. If you do technical work in the digital humanities and are intersted in like-minded people, [consider joining](https://dh-tech.github.io/join/)!
